Discipline by consequence

You don't need
motivation.
You need
consequence.
RIGOR is a contract with yourself. Set a rule, complete it before the deadline, or the failure is recorded forever.

Free to start. No ads. No BS.

The real problem

You already know what you need to do.
The problem is nothing happens when you don't.
You download the app. Set everything up. Start excited. Three days later, you forget. A week later, you delete it. Next month, repeat the cycle with another app.

The problem was never lack of information. It's excess freedom. You can stop whenever, edit whenever, reset whenever.

And that's why you stop. Always.

The difference

What happens with most habit apps.
They congratulate you for opening the app
They let you edit goals mid-way
They reset your progress with no consequence
They use streaks you can restart infinitely
They send cute motivational notifications
RIGOR does none of that.

Here, failure is permanent. The record is public. And nobody's going to pat you on the back.

How it works

One contract. No negotiation.
01
Define a rule
A specific action you commit to every day. "Study for 1 hour", "Work out", "Wake up at 5am". Pick one.

02
Set the deadline
The time limit to complete it. Missed the deadline? Failure recorded. No extension, no appeal.

03
Sign the contract
Choose the duration: 14, 30, or 66 days. Once signed, it can't be edited, paused, or cancelled. The contract is irreversible.

04
Complete or fail
Each day is a permanent record. Completed: recorded. Failed: recorded. Forever. No reset.

Progressive difficulty

The deadline shrinks.
You don't choose when.
Every 7 consecutive days without failure, your deadline is reduced by 30 minutes. Automatically. No gentle warning.

If you set your deadline at 6:00 PM, after a perfect week your new deadline is 5:30 PM. Two weeks: 5:00 PM.

The system gets harder as you improve. Comfort is not an option.

Week 1: until 6:00 PM

Week 2: until 5:30 PM

Week 3: until 5:00 PM

And so on.

Social pressure

Squads: fail and get removed.
Create or join a group. All members are under the same commitment. If someone fails, they're automatically eliminated.

There's no "bad day" in a Squad. There's completion or elimination. The group works as real social pressure — not a support group.

Permanent record

Each day is a record.
You can't erase it.
Completion rate
Current streak
Recorded failures
Squad position
Progress
Days completed. Failures. Streaks. Consistency heatmap.

All visible. All permanent.

Real consequences

Failing isn't neutral.
Failing hurts.
Temporary lockout
Failed? The app locks you out. You don't decide when you come back.

Mandatory justification
Before continuing, you're forced to write why you failed. Face self-deception in writing.

Critical failure
Marked in red in your history. Visible forever. To you and your Squad.

RIGOR isn't for everyone.
If you want praise, this isn't the place.

If you want flexibility, this isn't the place.

If you want to reset when you fail, this isn't the place.

No editing. No pausing. No excuses.
